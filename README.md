# Quadrupedal_Robot
The project was to make a Quadrupedal robot (Robot dog). Each leg would have 3
servos, each being controlled with its own PWM and timers. Interrupt is used on
a button on the bottom of the feet to indicate when the leg has touched the
ground. The Robot could walk forward and backward through the
press of another button.
