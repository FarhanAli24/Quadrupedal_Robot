# Quadrupedal_Robot
The project was to make a Quadrupedal robot (Robot dog). Each leg would have 3
servos, each being controlled with its own PWM and timers. Interrupt is used on
a button on the bottom of the feet to indicate when the leg has touched the
ground. The Robot could walk forward and backward through the
press of another button. There are two versions of the code at different stages. Written in Python and C. Code Written in Python was developed for Raspberry Pi 3. C was developed for the TI MSP432R microcontroller seen under "MicroProject". I learned to use it in one of my classes.
